1. Python Program for Fibonacci numbers.

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …….. In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation.

2. Python program to print all positive numbers in a range.

Your Input and output must look something like this

Input: list1 = [12, -7, 5, 64, -14] Output: 12, 5, 64

Input: list2 = [12, 14, -95, 3] Output: [12, 14, 3]

3. Write Python code to create a function called most_frequent that takes a string and prints the letters in decreasing order of frequency. Use dictionaries.
